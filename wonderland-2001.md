Our inaugural journey. Let's face it we were green, our backpacks weighed _way to much_ and we didn't understand what we were getting ourselves into. That didn't stop us from setting out on a 6 day, 35 mile trip around one third of mount rainier on the wonderland trail. On this adventure Keith, Mike, Clint and Jeff set out in late July with dreams of clear mountain views and alpine meadows blooming at the height of summer. We were not disappointed.
