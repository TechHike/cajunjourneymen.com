Keith is the architect and engineer of our adventures. No one is more dedicated to The Journeymen. His experience as a Boy Scout Leader and paramedic come in handy when it comes to planning and executing Journeymen trips. On the trail Keith is the quiet type, but he always keeps a watchful eye over the group. If any member has a need for an item on the trail Keith usually has it stored within reach. As a fee for this capability Keith only requires 1/5th of wild turkey bourbon every 4 days.

Mike is the free spirit and motivator of the group. He is responsible for suppling the necessary spark which fuels The Journeymen onward and upward. Out on the trail, Mike is usually the person lifting spirits on a rainy/snowy day or exalting the latest triumph. Sometimes he will even go so far as to transform into an alter-ego such as pee-wee herman or spiderman when conditions are right.

###Brian Guidry
Brian is a man out to push his own limits. Having never been on a mountain in his entire life, Brian completed 3 grueling adventures with The Journeymen in Colorado and Yosemite. He even endured constant razzing from the group in the process! By the way, if you meet Brian, don't bring up half dome.
