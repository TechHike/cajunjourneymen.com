A new group of adventurous soles have joined us to hike, kayak, ski, 
fish and party. We welcome them to the Cajun Journeymen fraternity. Walter 
"Coon Watch" Comeaux, John "Yankee" Zuschlag, and Justin "Dingo" Back 
have endured the test by conquering the swamp, sinking the hook, sucking 
in the thin altitude air, and shooting moonshine. They have passed the 
initiation and board vetting, welcome to the group!
